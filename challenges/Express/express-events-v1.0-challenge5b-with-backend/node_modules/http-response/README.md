http-response
=============

Get info about HTTP codes right in your terminal

Did you ever forget what an HTTP code was about, and found yourself looking trough the internet to find out it's meaning or purpose? That's why I made this tool. With it, you can get not only the name of the code but also it's type and description directly from Wikipedia on your terminal emulator.
